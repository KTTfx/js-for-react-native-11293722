**User Profile Creator with Potential Name Processing**
This code creates user profiles with unique IDs and original names. It leverages helper functions for potential name manipulation:

**processArray (implementation required)** 
Transforms an array, likely for pre-processing names before profile creation.
formatArrayStrings (implementation required): Modifies strings in an array based on corresponding numbers in another array, potentially altering names for profiles.

**How to Use:**
Implement the processArray and formatArrayStrings functions to suit your specific name processing needs. Consider including comments within those functions to explain your approach.
Update the originalNames array with the desired names you want user profiles for.

**What it Does:**
The code will create user profiles with unique IDs, original names, and potentially modified names based on your implementation of formatArrayStrings.
